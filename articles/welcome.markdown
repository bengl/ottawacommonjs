**Ottawa CommonJS** is a group of JavaScript enthusiasts in Ottawa, Canada,  who think that JavaScript doesn't have to be only in web browsers.  We meet semi-regularly and informally at [The Code Factory].  Stay tuned here for details on the next meetup!

## "What is CommonJS?" ##

[CommonJS] is a developing standard for multipurpose JavaScript, with a bit of a lean toward server-side programming.  It adds some features to the language that enable it to be useful in all sorts of environments.  

CommonJS is implemented by many framkeworks, including, but not limited to  [Narwhal], [Node.js], [Persevere] and [SproutCore].  Of these, Node.js (sometimes simply called "node") has shown the greatest amount of recent popularity, which can be attributed to the ease at which one can create networking applications with it.
