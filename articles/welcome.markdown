**Ottawa CommonJS** is a group of JavaScript enthusiasts in Ottawa, Canada,  who think that JavaScript doesn't have to be only in web browsers.  We meet semi-regularly and informally at [The Code Factory].  Stay tuned here for details on the next meetup!

This website is powered by [Node.js] and [Wheat] and is forked from [howtonode.org].  If you'd like to contribute to this website, feel free to [fork].  In fact, please do, since this site needs a new theme!

### What is CommonJS? ###

[CommonJS] is a developing standard for multipurpose JavaScript, with a bit of a lean toward server-side programming.  It adds some features to the language that enable it to be useful in all sorts of environments.  Most notably, it adds the ability to include/import other JavaScript files.

CommonJS is implemented by many framkeworks, including, but not limited to  [Narwhal], [Node.js], [Persevere] and [SproutCore].  Of these, Node.js (sometimes simply called "node") has shown the greatest amount of recent popularity, which can be at least partially attributed to the ease at which one can create networking applications with it.

### Why the group/meetups? ###

Many technologies have their own user groups in Ottawa.  These include [OGRE], [CocoaHeads], [SmallTalk] and many more.  These groups provide their members with a way of discussing these technologies in an open and informal manner, and allow for newcomers to learn in a more face-to-face setting. Some of these groups have proven to be successful at connecting people and their ideas and knowledge, and Ottawa CommonJS aims to replicate that success.
