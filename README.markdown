    Title: Control Flow in Node Part II
    Author: Tim Caswell
    Date: Thu Feb 04 2010 02:24:35 GMT-0600 (CST)
    Node: v0.1.91

    I had so much fun writing the last article on control flow, that I decided to...

    ## First section: Display JavaScript files
    
    * display contents of external JavaScript file (path is relative to .markdown file)
    <test-code/test-file.js>

    * display contents of external JavaScript file and evaluate its contents 
    <test-code/evaluate-file.js*>

    More content goes here.

More docs to come soon...
